This file contains three columns of data. The first two are two different tests performs on microchips. The first test is a temperature test, it determines out of 100 (100 being the best) how well the components withstood and the microchip functioned after being put under high temperatures. The second test determined how sturdy the components of the microchip were and how well it functioned after being subject to rough handling (ie, random shaking, bouncing movements). The third column is either a 0 or 1. This indicates whether the microchip was accepted or rejected. Microchip data from 1994.
