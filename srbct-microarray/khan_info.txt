Khan Gene Data

Description: The data consists of a number of tissue samples corresponding to four distinct types of small round blue cell tumors. For each tissue sample, 2308 gene expression measurements are available. SBRCT gene expression data. 2318 genes, 63 training samples, 25 test samples. One gene per row, one sample per column. Cancer classes are labelled 1,2,3,4,5 for c("EWS","RMS","NB","BL")


Format
The format is a list containing four components: xtrain, xtest, ytrain, and ytest. xtrain contains the 2308 gene expression values for 63 subjects and ytrain records the corresponding tumor type. ytrain and ytest contain the corresponding testing sample information for a further 20 subjects.
